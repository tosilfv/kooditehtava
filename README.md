## Project Background

This is a home assignment project given to me by a Web Development Company.<br />
I decided not to use TDD for this project, because I haven't got a routine for that yet. Also I didn't want to draw a block diagram of the layout because it seems to me that a simple input and display on a one page website would be enough. As I am pressed for time and I have mostly been practicing making lists in React recently, i.e. over two months ago, I decided to use an old project as a base, even though it might be too complicated for such a purpose. Also I haven't been coding very much this year for different reasons, so I have lost my touch a little.<br />

## Plan Steps

DONE Step 1. Create a GitHub repository.<br />
Step 2. Use the booklist project as a base for the app.<br />
Step 3. Read about Roman numerals from Wikipedia and get the general idea of the task at hand.<br />
Step 4. Make a first rough working version of converting an 'I' to '1' and display the result.<br />
Step 5. Expand the idea from Step 4 to cover more cases.<br />
Step 6. Make the program smarter by refactoring the code to other files.<br />
Step 7. Check up on the time and see if you can make the app prettier.<br />
Step 8. Wrap up and push the final version.<br />
Step 9. Send the link to this repository back to the employer.<br />

## Design decisions

The app is written using Hooks (New React) and it utilizes Material.ui theming.
